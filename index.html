        <p>During his education, he was influenced by Keshob Chandra Sen's Naba Bidhan Organization, a breakaway fraction of Brahma Samaj. In this cultic milieu, Narendranath became acquainted with western esotericism and developed a belief in formless God and a deprecation of idoltry, and rejected the Advaita Vedanta of identity with the absolute.</p>
        <p>He met Ramkrishna(RK) in 1881 with disbeliefs on him and his intellectual quest of God became immense. Later with many an altercation, he grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God and accepted Ramkrishna as Guru in 1884. In 1885 he took Ochre robes(Sannyas) from RK and was taught that service to men is the effective work to God. After the demise of RK in 1886 he was busy in organising the other disciples through austerity for becoming true followers of RK.</p>

        <p><strong>His Philosophy - </strong> Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling nature, external or internal. Do this either by work, or worship , or mental discipline, or philosophy---- by one, or more, or all of these---and be free. This is the whole religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms are but of secondary.</p>
